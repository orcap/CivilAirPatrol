# Civil Air Patrol Document Repository

This is a repository of public CAP publications and documents.  The intent is to pull documents from a number of different locations into one easy to use file structure.  Using GIT makes updating documents easy and synchronizing them across multiple devices.

Please note that this project is in the early phases and this repository will be undergoing a lot of change initially.

## Contributions
Please feel free to make recommendations, contribute additional documents, or update existing documents with new additions.
